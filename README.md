# Question Framework

## Basic Usage

```python
from question_framework.question import Question, RepeatedQuestion, BranchedQuestion
from question_framework.user_input import ask

questions = [Question("Name", "Your name:")]
answers = ask(questions)
print(answers)
```

Output:

```bash
Your name:
foobar
{'Name': 'foobar'}
```

## Question Types

### Question

`Question` is basically a question with an answer.

```python
questions = [Question("Name", "Your name:")]
answers = ask(questions)
print(answers)
```

Output:

```bash
Your name:
John Doe
{'Name': 'John Doe'}
```

### Repeated Question

`RepeatedQuestion` can be used to ask same question consecutively.

```python
questions = [RepeatedQuestion("Password", "Your password:", 3)]
answers = ask(questions)
print(answers)
```

Output:

```bash
Your password:
123
Your password:
321
Your password:
765
{'Password': ['123', '321', '765']}
```

### Branched Question

`BranchedQuestion` can be used to create one way adventures.

```python
game = [BranchedQuestion("Main", "Where to go? [N | E | S | W]", [
    Question("N", "North is cold. You died! (type anything to exit)"),
    Question("E", "You trigerred the trap. (type anything to exit)"),
    BranchedQuestion("S", "You found a tresure chest! [open | leave]", [
        Question("open", "It was a trap! (type anything to exit)"),
        Question("leave", "You leave the cave.. (type anything to exit)"),
    ]),
    Question("W", "West is wild, you died! (type anything to exit)"),
])]
answers = ask(game)
```

### Static Answers

"StaticAnswer" can be used to provide a default value.

```python
from question_framework.question import BranchedQuestion, StaticAnswer, Question
questions = [BranchedQuestion("password", "Do you want to enter a password? [y|n]", [
    Question("y", "What is your password?"),
    StaticAnswer("n", "No password.")
])]
answers = ask(questions)
```

Output:

```bash
Do you want to enter a password? [y|n]
n
{'password': {'n': 'No password.', '__answer': 'n'}}
```

## Validations

A validation function can be specified to validate answers. If validation fails, user will be asked to enter the input again.

```python
Question("Password", "Enter password:", validation=lambda x: len(x) > 5)
```

### Validation Error Messages

When a user provides input that does not satify a validation function, it may be desireable to give them a message.  The ValidationError exception allows this.

To use, raise the ValidationError exception from your validation function with your desired message.

```python
from question_framework.question import Question
from question_framework.user_input import ask
from question_framework.validation import ValidationError

def is_not_blank(x):
    if not x:
        raise ValidationError("Your answer may not be blank.")
    return True

questions = [Question("Name", "Your name:", validation=is_not_blank)]
answers = ask(questions)
```

Output:

```bash
Your name:
Your answer may not be blank.
Your name:
David
{'Name': 'David'}
```

## Post process

A post process can be specified to transform answer.

```python
Question("Firstname", "Enter firstname:", post_process=lambda x: x.upper())
```
